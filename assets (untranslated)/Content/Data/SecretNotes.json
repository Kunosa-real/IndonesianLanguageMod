I hope things are going well!^I'm honored that you're continuing the family tradition of farming, and through that noble endeavor, bringing greater life and abundance to all of Stardew Valley... a place very dear to my heart.^Keep up the good work!^^-Grandpa^^P.S. ...I've hidden a very special secret for you somewhere in the valley.
